//! Read-only dispositions derived from NQ reliance testimony.
//!
//! Night Shift consumes `nq.reliance.receipt.v1` exactly as NQ emits it and
//! proposes a **posture**. It does not re-evaluate evidence, resolve
//! contradictions, discharge obligations, retry, repair, or execute anything.
//!
//! # The distinction this module exists to hold
//!
//! > A fresh NQ refusal is NQ testimony.
//! > No fresh NQ response is Night Shift's own observation.
//!
//! [`SourceState`] keeps the six input cases apart. Only `Fresh` is current NQ
//! testimony. `NoResponse`, `TransportUnavailable`, and `Malformed` are Night
//! Shift orchestration or integrity observations, and **no synthetic NQ receipt
//! is ever fabricated for them**.
//!
//! Deliberately *not* reused, per the boundary audit: `bundle::RelianceClass`
//! (Night Shift's own weighting of how far a bundle input may be leaned on — a
//! different question with a different owner) and `packet::AttentionState`
//! (who is looking, not what to do).
