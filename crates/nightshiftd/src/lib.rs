//! Canonical Nightshift temporal observation and attention office.
//!
//! This crate schedules exact observation cycles, consumes qualified present
//! support and complete NQ diagnostics, computes non-authorizing posture and
//! attention, and submits immutable exact-work proposals to AG. It has no
//! standing, authorization, execution-custody, effect, or AG-continuation API.
