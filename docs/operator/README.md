# Nightshift operator quick start

**Status:** canonical development runtime; not yet operationally qualified.
Nightshift observes and records posture. It does not authorize or execute an
effect.

## Build contract

```sh
cargo build --locked --release --bin nightshift
./target/release/nightshift cycle --help
```

The workspace has no sibling Wicket/WLP dependency. A native C toolchain is
required for bundled SQLite.

## Required external ports

One observation cycle requires:

- a sealed `CanonicalCycleRequestV1` produced by the workflow integration;
- the NQ-NG `nq` executable, its config locator, and the stable expected
  `nq-store-genesis:<id>` source identity; the service identity needs narrowly
  read-only access to that source;
- an executable whose basename is exactly `pulse-support-resolver` and which
  returns an exact query-bound `QualifiedSupportV1`;
- an operator-owned Nightshift SQLite path.

The NQ executable must be the NQ-NG operator CLI, not Debian's unrelated
queueing utility of the same name and not Classic NQ's `nq-monitor`. Verify the
closed read boundary before enabling a cycle:

```sh
/absolute/path/to/nq --help
/absolute/path/to/nq diagnostics qualify --help
```

Both checks are intentional. Debian's unrelated queueing utility rejects the
first even though it may return success for arbitrary trailing command words;
an older NQ-NG build passes the first but refuses the second.

NQ-NG's package intentionally conflicts with Debian's `nq` package rather
than overwriting it. Selecting and installing NQ-NG remains an explicit
deployment/cutover decision.

If the request contains exact work, the cycle additionally requires paths to
`ag-loopctl`, AG's database, AG's observation resolver and expected identity,
and AG's deployment-owned runtime profile. Those are the only
consequence-adjacent Nightshift calls. Nightshift never accepts a Docket or
executor endpoint.

```sh
nightshift \
  --store /var/lib/nightshift/nightshift.sqlite \
  cycle run \
  --request /etc/nightshift/cycles/current.json \
  --nq-program /usr/local/bin/nq \
  --nq-config /etc/nq/nq.toml \
  --nq-source-id nq-store-genesis:DEPLOYMENT_GENESIS_ID \
  --present-evidence-resolver /usr/local/bin/pulse-support-resolver
```

NQ-NG admission is checked before the recurrence slot is claimed. It makes
the exact artifact eligible for Nightshift reasoning; it does not establish
currentness or authorize the optional work proposal.

For exact work, append:

```sh
  --ag-loopctl /usr/local/bin/ag-loopctl \
  --ag-database /var/lib/ag/campaign.sqlite \
  --ag-observation-resolver /usr/local/bin/ag-observation-resolver \
  --ag-observation-resolver-id nightshift-observation-resolver/v1 \
  --ag-runtime-profile /etc/ag/governed-loop-profile.json
```

AG options are forbidden on posture-only requests, and all five are mandatory
on requests containing a proposal.

## Authenticated Maude authoring context

For a newly Maude-authored proposal, the base request and its separately
sealed handoff are passed with the two distinct deployment credentials:

```sh
  --maude-authoring-handoff /run/nightshift/handoff.json \
  --maude-custody-credential /run/credentials/maude-handoff-producer.key \
  --maude-producer-principal-id maude-handoff:local \
  --maude-producer-key-id maude-handoff-key:primary \
  --maude-session-custody-credential /run/credentials/maude-session-issuer.key \
  --maude-session-issuer-principal-id maude:supervisor \
  --maude-session-issuer-key-id maude-session-key:primary \
  --nightshift-runtime-id nightshift:local-c1
```

The credential files contain exactly 32 raw bytes, are non-symlink regular
files, and must not be group-writable/executable or accessible by others.
Producer and session-issuer credentials must differ. These options are all
required together when authoring context is present and are refused when it is
absent. The full transport, replay, restart, and environmental contract is in
[`../authoring-context-custody.md`](../authoring-context-custody.md).

## Read local cycle state

```sh
nightshift --store /var/lib/nightshift/nightshift.sqlite cycle list
nightshift --store /var/lib/nightshift/nightshift.sqlite cycle show --cycle-id '<cycle-id>'
nightshift --store /var/lib/nightshift/nightshift.sqlite cycle replay --cycle-id '<cycle-id>'
```

Text output is presentation only. The durable cycle record retains exact
support, diagnostic, posture, AG occurrence, attempt, and settlement
references.

## Restart and AG status

```sh
nightshift --store /var/lib/nightshift/nightshift.sqlite cycle recover \
  --ag-loopctl /usr/local/bin/ag-loopctl \
  --ag-database /var/lib/ag/campaign.sqlite \
  --ag-observation-resolver /usr/local/bin/ag-observation-resolver \
  --ag-observation-resolver-id nightshift-observation-resolver/v1 \
  --ag-runtime-profile /etc/ag/governed-loop-profile.json \
  --observed-at 2026-08-11T12:00:00Z
```

Restart never recreates support currentness, an AG authorization, or an
execution capability. Locally in-flight observation work becomes recovery
required. Prepared AG work is queried by exact occurrence status and is never
resubmitted by Nightshift. Reconciliation and human disposition remain AG
operations.

## Settlement law

An AG settlement supplies only exact occurrence/attempt/outcome provenance.
Nightshift records it and enters observation-required posture. Success does not
mean healthy, failure does not diagnose the cause, and indeterminate never
causes a repeat.

Workflow-specific application/world evidence may be retained through the
authenticated [external-observation custody contract](../EXTERNAL_OBSERVATION_CUSTODY_V1.md).
Custody is deliberately separate from canonical observation cycles:
source-evidence age is not Nightshift currentness, and settlement remains
neither health nor recovery. The closed
[external-evidence composition contract](../EXTERNAL_EVIDENCE_COMPOSITION_V1.md)
allows one deployment-profiled record to participate in an exact successor
observation; Nightshift still evaluates currentness at consequence time.
The decision-relative
[qualification and steady-state contract](../QUALIFICATION_AND_STEADY_STATE_EVIDENCE_V1.md)
adds a separate read-only local-Compose adapter. It may refresh passive
steady-state claims after an owner-produced stale result while retaining the
original fault-test qualification as historical, exact-artifact-bound evidence.
It cannot repeat or claim a new failure test.

The deployment-owned example profile is
[`examples/steady-state-evidence-profile-v1.json`](examples/steady-state-evidence-profile-v1.json).
Nightshift produces an exact absent/current/stale acquisition basis without
mutating runtime state:

```sh
nightshift --store /var/lib/nightshift/nightshift.sqlite \
  external-observation steady-state-basis \
  --qualification-observation-id sha256:EXACT_Q \
  --profile /etc/nightshift/steady-state-evidence-profile.jcs.json \
  --evaluated-at-unix-ms 1787450848101
```

After the distinct passive handoff is admitted, the read-only packager binds
Q and S into the base request:

```sh
nightshift --store /var/lib/nightshift/nightshift.sqlite \
  external-observation prepare-decision-cycle \
  --request /bounded/successor-cycle-base.jcs.json \
  --profile /etc/nightshift/steady-state-evidence-profile.jcs.json
```

The normal cycle run receives the same profile independently with
`--decision-evidence-profile`. Packaging, import, and age arithmetic never
construct Nightshift currentness.

## Scheduling

Reference systemd files are under [`../../deploy/systemd/`](../../deploy/systemd/).
They preserve the existing boot delay, five-minute wake cadence, jitter, and
`Persistent=true`. Every firing attempts one exact recurrence slot; generation
equality never satisfies a slot.

The `deploy/systemd/user/` shelf is historical and nonportable. Do not install
it.

## Diagnostic specimen

The checked-in [diagnostic-posture fixture](examples/diagnostic-posture-v1/README.md)
documents the complete NQ/posture basis consumed inside a canonical cycle. It
is a library/conformance specimen, not a second production CLI.
