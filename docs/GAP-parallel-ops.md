## Core problem

Classic Night Shift failure mode:

> Claude executes a double live migration, updates zero memories,
> user has to audit him mid-flight.

Generalized: multiple actors (sessions, agents, operators, cron jobs)
work on overlapping scope. Each has local context. None has the
others'. A shared substrate (Continuity) may be *hooked in* and still
not be *used*. Scope changes don't propagate. Reconciliation runs
against a world that already moved.

This is different from:

- **Attention state** (`GAP-attention-state.md`): a single operator's
  intent decays without a half-life.
- **Staleness** (`GAP-escalation.md` trigger 4): captured inputs are
  no longer current against an external source of truth.

This failure mode is specifically: *another actor's work has changed
the scope, and nobody told us.*

## Ritualized recall

The failure mode this doc exists to prevent is not *forgetting*. It
is *failing to ritualize recall*.

Every NOC figured this out: channels, bridge notes, shift handoffs,
incident commander handoffs. Those primitives existed because without
them, locally-rational actors manufacture global incoherence.

> The failure is not lack of intelligence. It is lack of ritualized
> recall.

Night Shift's job is not to make the substrate smarter. It is to
make *consulting the substrate* a structural step, not an act of
operator virtue.

The motivating meta-irony is worth preserving explicitly:

> The coordination channel existed; neither agent consulted it. The
> framework that would have caught the incident was the framework
> already in place. Memory was available; it was not queried.

That is the failure mode. Memory availability does not imply memory
consultation. Night Shift promotes consultation from habit to
structure.

## Scope overlap types

```text
disjoint          no shared hosts / services / paths — no coordination required
shared_read      overlapping read scope, no mutation — coordination nice-to-have
shared_write     overlapping mutation surface — coordination required
contested        two actors attempting mutually-exclusive actions — must resolve before proceeding
```

The reconciler must classify; actors do not get to self-declare
`disjoint`.

## Reconciler protocol extension

Capture and reconciliation both grow a concurrent-activity check.

### At capture

The bundle gains an input:

```yaml
- input_id: continuity:concurrent_activity:scope:<scope_key>
  source: continuity
  kind: concurrent_scope_activity
  status: observed
  evidence_hash: sha256:...
  freshness:
    invalidates_if:
      - concurrent_actor_transitioned_state
      - concurrent_actor_opened_new_scope_overlap
  payload_ref: continuity://query:scope=<scope_key>,window=<T>
```

`<scope_key>` derives deterministically from the agenda's declared
scope (hosts × services × paths × repos).

### At reconciliation

The reconciler classifies overlap and records it:

```yaml
- input_id: continuity:concurrent_activity:scope:<scope_key>
  status: committed
  reliance_class: authoritative_for_coordination   # narrow — see two-layer model below
  scope:
    run_id: run_...
    valid_for: [coordination_gating, diagnosis, packet_context]
  concurrent_activity:
    actors:
      - actor_id: labelwatch-claude/mem_c1a452f0
        session: case:volume-migration-2026-04-17
        touched_at: 2026-04-17T13:42:00Z
        scope_overlap: shared_write
        last_breadcrumb: "nq-publish turned down; pending nq-claude"
    overlap_class: shared_write
    decision: hold_for_context | downgrade | proceed | escalate
```

The `decision` is not advisory. It gates promotion.

## Two-layer authority model

The concurrent-activity check is narrowly authoritative and must be
encoded carefully. Continuity cannot become a truth oracle via the
coordination channel.

Split the reliance story into two layers:

- **Coordination-gating authority (narrow):** the *fact* that
  overlapping activity exists in a given scope, and its
  *classification* (`disjoint / shared_read / shared_write /
  contested`), are authoritative **for coordination decisions only**.
  They gate whether the run may leave capture. They do not
  authorize policy, mutation, or ground truth claims.
- **Breadcrumb content (hint):** the payload of any individual
  breadcrumb — another actor's note, disposition, summary — is
  `observed` / `hint` material. It may *inform* a proposal or a
  packet but may not ground authorization or substitute for current
  evidence.

In schema terms this maps to:

```text
reliance_class: authoritative_for_coordination    # overlap existence + classification
valid_for:      [coordination_gating, diagnosis, packet_context]

breadcrumb payloads:   reliance_class: hint
                       valid_for: [diagnosis, packet_context]
```

> Continuity is authoritative about who else is here.
> Continuity is not authoritative about what is true.

Without this split, the coordination channel would smuggle
authority through the side door — exactly the failure mode
`DESIGN.md`'s Continuity rules are written to prevent.

## Risky classes of work

Default-query-on-capture is sufficient for routine scope. Some
classes of work require a stronger form — **preflight** — in which
Continuity is a gate, not a background signal.

Risky classes:

- **Shared-infrastructure ops.** Scope includes any resource other
  actors routinely touch (shared hosts, shared data paths, shared
  publishers, shared collectors).
- **Topology / config / publisher / source changes.** Anything that
  rewrites where observers look or what they can see.
- **Mode transitions.** A session crossing incident → remediation,
  remediation → architecture, or any crossing that changes the
  success condition. See `GAP-incident-modes.md`.
- **Protected-class scope.** Observation-critical or control-plane-
  critical services in read or write scope.
- **Unresolved breadcrumb in scope.** Another actor has filed a
  `run.surprise` or `run.partial` in this scope that has not been
  closed within the freshness window.

## Preflight check

Triggered at the boundary between capture and reconcile, before any
input is promoted from `observed` to `committed`. For risky classes
the run cannot leave capture without one of:

```text
clear                no concurrent risky activity; proceed
hold_for_context    concurrent activity exists; surface it, wait
coordinate          named actor has overlapping scope; handoff required
contested           mutually exclusive intent; escalate before proceeding
operator_override   named operator explicitly acknowledges concurrent
                    activity and continues
```

Invariants:

- Missing Continuity in a risky class is treated as `hold_for_context`
  at minimum; may be upgraded to `coordinate` if the agenda declares
  `shared_infrastructure: true`.
- `operator_override` must carry a named operator identity and a
  reason. It is a receipt-generating event; no silent override.
- Preflight outcome is audit material: `run.preflight_cleared`,
  `run.preflight_hold`, `run.preflight_override` breadcrumbs are
  emitted in all cases.
- Preflight is pre-Governor. An `operator_override` at preflight
  does not authorize mutation; Governor still gates force.

## Continuity-as-substrate invariant

> Continuity availability is not Continuity use.

Parallel to *"MCP is transport, not authority."* A hooked-in substrate
that isn't queried is a silent hazard. Night Shift does not trust
workflow authors to remember to ask; the reconciler queries Continuity
for concurrent activity in the declared scope **by default**, and the
run ledger writes observational breadcrumbs to Continuity **by default**.

Practically (when Continuity is configured):

- **Read**: reconciler queries Continuity for concurrent activity
  keyed on scope. Missing Continuity is handled per standard soft-
  dependency rules for ordinary runs (never raises authority; may
  require advise-only). For risky classes, missing Continuity
  triggers `hold_for_context` — see preflight rules below.
- **Write**: run ledger emits breadcrumbs on key transitions
  (capture, surprise, partial completion, escalation, terminal
  result), not only on run completion.

When Continuity is **not** configured (standalone / Core-tier
deployments per `DESIGN.md`):

- The run ledger mirrors breadcrumbs locally. Ordinary runs proceed
  with degraded coordination posture surfaced in the packet.
- Risky-class runs cannot clear preflight without Continuity; they
  hold or downgrade unless an `operator_override` is issued.

The "by default" defaults apply only where the substrate exists.
Saying Night Shift "writes to Continuity by default" does not
retroactively make Continuity mandatory for Core-tier standalone
operation.

## Breadcrumb cadence

> File a memory after each major surprise, not just at the end.

*— labelwatch-claude, self-reflecting after the fact*

End-of-run receipts are inadequate for parallel ops. If another actor
is mid-flight, they need to see your scope change *now*, not when
your run terminates. Required breadcrumb events:

```text
run.captured              scope + agenda + intent
run.surprise              anything not in the bundle happened (layout changed,
                          service is down, a dependency moved)
run.partial               mutation attempted and partially succeeded
run.escalated             run stopped with operator-required next step
run.completed             terminal state + summary
run.attention_changed     operator touched attention state for any finding in scope
```

Breadcrumbs are observational, not authoritative. They live in
Continuity as `observed` entries. Other actors' reconcilers may
*admit* them as hints — never as authorization.

## Breadcrumb latency

The time between *surprise-landing* and *surprise-filed* is itself a
signal. A well-behaved session files near the event. A session that
only files at end-of-run has compressed every surprise into one
retrospective blob, losing detail and losing the window where other
actors could have benefited.

Tracked per session:

```text
surprise_filed_latency_p50 / p95       for breadcrumbs of kind `run.surprise`
filed_at_end_of_run_ratio              fraction of surprises only captured in terminal summary
```

Night Shift surfaces these in operator self-review. They are not
punitive metrics; they are diagnostic — a rising latency is a signal
that in-flight reflection is decaying, which tends to precede
coordination failures.

> The failure mode is not that breadcrumbs are missing. It is that
> they are all stamped `end_of_run`.

## Natural breakpoints

Night Shift does not *require* operators to file breadcrumbs at
arbitrary intervals. It prompts at structurally meaningful moments —
natural breakpoints where capturing cost is low and recall is still
sharp:

```text
surprise resolved               an unexpected finding has a disposition (fixed / deferred / escalated)
service restart verified        a restart or re-point has confirmed post-condition
quiesce window reached          a pause or cooldown gate has fired
dependency interaction          an adjacent service has been touched or re-pointed
authority transition            attention state changed (acked, investigating, handed_off)
phase transition                incident state advanced (see GAP-incident-modes.md)
```

At each, Night Shift may emit a **breadcrumb prompt**: a low-friction
suggestion to file a short observation, scoped to the just-completed
event. The prompt is optional; the *prompt event* itself is logged so
the not-filed case is visible.

## Passive watching, active nudging

Night Shift can operate as a passive substrate (reconciler queries
Continuity; operator writes when they remember) or as an active
partner (session-attached watcher that emits breadcrumb prompts at
natural breakpoints). The active mode is opt-in per session, not
default, because:

- active nudging risks becoming interruption theatre
- the operator's judgment about "major" still governs what's worth
  capturing
- the watcher's job is to *lower the friction of filing*, not to
  enforce filing

A nudged-but-not-filed event is still a useful signal. It tells
Night Shift the operator saw the moment and declined, which is
different from the operator never seeing it.

## Invariants

- **Continuity availability is not Continuity use.** Hooked in ≠ used.
  The reconciler queries by default; the run ledger writes by default.
- **No `disjoint` self-declaration.** Overlap classification is the
  reconciler's job, grounded in declared scope.
- **`contested` is terminal until resolved.** If two actors hold
  overlapping mutation intent in the same scope, Night Shift escalates
  rather than racing.
- **Breadcrumbs are observations, not authority.** Another actor's
  run log may inform this run's proposal; it may not authorize it.
- **Missing Continuity is a soft dependency.** Follows standard rule:
  may lower promotion ceiling; never raises authority; never
  fabricates authorization.

## Failure modes this prevents

- Two sessions silently racing a migration
- One session's "this is handled" invisible to another session
- Reconciliation passing because the bundle's inputs matched, while
  the world changed between runs via a different actor
- Continuity hooked in but only written to at end-of-run, when it's
  too late to warn anyone

## Failure modes this does NOT prevent

- Actors not on Continuity at all (outside the substrate entirely)
- Actors writing breadcrumbs to Continuity but lying in them
- Operators acting directly against a host outside any Night Shift run

Those are out-of-band. Coordination only covers the actors inside the
substrate. Anyone outside it is a scope-overlap risk the reconciler
cannot see.

## Interaction with attention-state

Another actor's recent transition of attention state for a shared
finding shows up in the concurrent-activity check. If labelwatch-
claude marked `investigating` on a shared finding, nq-claude's next
Night Shift run must see that and decide: defer, coordinate, or
escalate `contested`.

Attention state in Continuity is subject to the same TTLs and ack
expiry rules as local attention state. An expired-ack breadcrumb does
not suppress re-alert.

## Interaction with Governor

Governor authorizes force in a single run. Parallel-ops coordination
is *pre*-Governor: the reconciler's scope-overlap classification
happens before any authorization request. If the overlap class is
`contested`, Night Shift does not ask Governor for authorization;
it escalates for operator resolution first.

Governor may still be asked to *log* the escalation as a receipt.

## Interaction with `--no-governor` degraded mode

Parallel-ops check is orthogonal to Governor. Without Governor,
Night Shift still queries Continuity for concurrent activity and
still writes breadcrumbs. Degradation lowers authority, not
coordination.

## Open questions

- What defines the scope key? (Canonicalized scope tuple: hosts ×
  services × paths × repos. Deterministic hash so different actors
  hash the same scope identically.)
- How long is the concurrent-activity window? (Probably agenda-
  declared, default 24h; longer for `safety`-class agendas.)
- What if Continuity disagrees with NQ about what's happening in
  scope? (Reconciler treats them as separate sources; evidence-conflict
  trigger in `GAP-escalation.md` applies.)
- Do breadcrumbs need receipts? (Probably not individually; the run
  ledger's emission of the breadcrumb is the receipt. But the ledger
  event itself must be receiptable.)
- How does this interact with multi-tenant v3 deployments? (Scope
  keys must include a tenant boundary; cross-tenant concurrent-activity
  check is a trust decision, not a coordination one.)
