## Role

Night Shift manages admissibility across time. Its job is not to decide whether action is authorized, but to prevent old observations, stale plans, and deferred work from silently becoming current authority.

Pair with NQ (premise-movement detection) and Governor (authorization decisions): *NQ detects that the premise moved. Governor decides whether the authorization fell off. Night Shift makes that movement legible across the deferral.*

---

## Quick start

```bash
cargo build
cargo test
cargo run --bin nightshift -- --help
```

The production executable surface is two binaries: `nightshift` (the
canonical observation-cycle runtime) and `nightshift-observation-resolver`
(a one-shot, read-only evidence translator for AG's observation-resolution
boundary; it has no cycle-mutation, AG, Docket, or executor surface). The
structural gate `scripts/check_no_actuation_surface.sh` enforces the closed
production graph.

The semantic runtime boundary contract — proposal recording, exact-work
binding, evidence bases, observation currentness and lineage, workflow
preconditions, standing, authorization, and the Docket seam — is defined by
`docs/CANONICAL_RUNTIME_C1.md`.

## Tests

```bash
cargo test
```

The full Nightshift → AG → Docket integration suite
(`crates/nightshiftd/tests/ag_governed_integration.rs`) is opt-in because it
drives adjacent-repository binaries (`ag-loopctl`, `ag-standing-resolver`,
`ag-effectd`, and the Docket binary); `docs/CANONICAL_RUNTIME_C1.md` records
the exact invocation environment.

Always run tests before proposing commits. Never claim tests pass
without running them.

## Safety and irreversibility

### Do not do these without explicit user confirmation
- Push to remote, create/close PRs or issues
- Delete or rewrite git history
- Modify dependency files in ways that change the lock file
- Any action that would promote an agenda beyond `propose` stage
- Anything that touches Governor policy or NQ configuration

### Preferred workflow
- Make changes in small, reviewable steps
- Run tests locally before proposing commits
- For any operation that affects external state, require explicit user confirmation

---

## Repository layout

The canonical runtime is a single Rust crate:

```
crates/nightshiftd/         Rust crate — canonical runtime + library
  src/
    canonical_runtime.rs    Observation-cycle runtime (slot → posture → intent)
    canonical_store.rs      Authoritative SQLite cycle/slot/event state
    diagnostic_posture.rs   Posture evaluation over complete NQ evidence
    decision_basis.rs       DecisionBasisV1 projection + frozen vocabulary
    currentness.rs          Qualified-support boundary
    observation_resolver.rs Read-only AG observation-evidence translator
    ag_port.rs              ag-loopctl adapter (status/init/continue/record-proposal)
    bin/nightshift.rs       `nightshift` CLI
    bin/nightshift_observation_resolver.rs  read-only resolver binary
  tests/                    Integration tests (incl. the opt-in full-chain
                            Nightshift → AG → Docket suite)
docs/
  CANONICAL_RUNTIME_C1.md   The authoritative runtime boundary contract
  architecture/             Ratified design (pre-C1 documents bannered as such)
  theory/                   Positioning docs
  operator/                 Operator examples and surface docs
  working/                  Working/historical tree: gaps, decisions, roadmaps
```

## Coding conventions

- Rust: stable toolchain, clippy clean, no unsafe without justification
- Receipts: content-addressed, append-only, deterministic
- The canonical authority office for governed work is AG ng; there is no
  production classic-Governor integration in this crate

---

## Invariants

1. No mutation without Governor authorization. Night Shift proposes; Governor permits.
2. Context bundles must be reconciled before execution. Stale context is not evidence.
3. Every run produces receipts. If it happened without a receipt, it didn't happen correctly.
4. Promotion is explicit and sequential. No step in `observe → reconcile → propose → authorize → execute → verify → publish` may be skipped.
5. MCP is tool transport, not authority. Tool availability is not permission.
6. Staleness escalates to revalidation, not action. Night Shift may schedule a recheck on stale evidence; it may not propose mutation against it.
7. Witness positions are NQ's grammar, not Night Shift's. NS consumes the finding shape NQ surfaces; it does not branch behavior on substrate / application_internal / application_external / platform_internal / platform_external. If position disagreement should change scheduling, NQ encodes it into the finding shape and NS responds to the shape.

---

## What this is not

- Not cron. Cron executes blindly; Night Shift reconciles before acting.
- Not Governor. Governor is the authority layer. Night Shift is the scheduling/promotion layer.
- Not an autonomous operator. It reduces toil without laundering accountability.

---

## When you're unsure

Ask for clarification rather than guessing, especially around:
- Whether a change affects the Governor integration boundary
- Anything involving the promotion path or escalation ladder
- Receipt schema changes (these are append-only contracts)
- Anything that changes a documented invariant
